I have learnt how to open the COVER:
- Select "Echo Rig" in collection of "Collection". use top right object selector list (Outliner) to find select it.
- Yes, Open that archive box "Collection", and click stickman "Echo Rig"
- Look Property window bottom right that has vertical tab. Click orange box with 4 corner brackets around it (Object Properties).
- Scroll down to Custom Properties. open that up. there are 4 custom properties
- try to slide the number of each properties, and see what you get. enjoy!

I also have found another object parts with custom properties:
- Lewd Body.Groin = Anal, Vag clit
- Lewd Body.Tits = Size of plumpee and nipley

What is that Purple thingy?! Why can't I change the properties in purple?
Those are drivers. drivers controls the properties by certain properties. search Blender Driver to learn about that.
In this case, the object parts are controlled by a custom properties from the parent of the character. One will follow this and otherwise counters the properties.
Since they have been controlled by properties, you cannot directly edit those properties in purple. Only able through those mentioned properties.

also I've tried my best to convey this for beginner.

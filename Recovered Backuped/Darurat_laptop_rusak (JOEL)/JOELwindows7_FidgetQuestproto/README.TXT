Read the Level_6() World class.

Each level will has it's own actor container per level, called stuff_N.
place your actor for your level inside that Stuff_N.
e.g., if you are on Level_6(), create class inside the Stuff, called Stuff_6.
N is number of the level.
Now, you can contain the actor there.
even contained, actors can still be loaded on other level! beware for the tidyness though.
